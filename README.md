# Named-Entity-Recognition-on-Twitter-Data
Built a supervised named entity recognizer for twitter dataset.  The training dataset are tweets annotated with name entities in BIO (Beginning of an entity, Inside an entity or Outside of entities) format. For 10 entity types, 21 possible classes.   Implemented Viterbi Algorithm for efficient sequence tagging. The program also performs feature engineering, and the conditional random field.
